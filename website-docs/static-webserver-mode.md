We can define the service endpoints to the `easer` server via standard endpoint descriptors, as the following Figure shows:

![Default Static Webserver Architecture](/easer/img/default-static-webserver-architecture.png)

However, in case we do not create endpoint descriptors, neither give it to easer, then the server uses its built-in descriptor, that looks like this:

```JSON
{
  "info": {
    "title": "An API that provides the current directory as static content",
    "version": "1.0"
  },
  "paths": {
    "/": {
      "get": {
        "responses": {
          "200": {
            "description": "OK"
          }
        },
        "x-static": {
          "config": {
            "dotfiles": "allow",
            "index": true
          },
          "contentPath": "<the-current-working-directory>"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "swagger": "2.0"
}
```

It defines one path that is `/`, and uses the `x-static` extensional property to tell the server that this path has to be forwarded to the static-middleware. This property also holds the configuration parameters of this middleware.

So step into a folder (for example the root of the easer repository) that contains the web content you want to observe, then start the server:

```bash
$ easer

2019-08-04T13:08:42.398Z [easer@4.0.0] info: Start up webServer
2019-08-04T13:08:42.409Z [easer@4.0.0] info: Express server listening on port 3007
2019-08-04T13:08:42.411Z [easer@4.0.0] info: App runs the jobs...
```

Open the [http://localhost:3007/](http://localhost:3007/) URL with a browser, then you will something like this:
