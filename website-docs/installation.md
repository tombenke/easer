## Prerequisites

In order to run the server, you need to have the Node.js and npm installed on your machine.


## Installation

The `easer` is made to act as a standalone application server, so it's preferred installation is:

```bash
npm install -g easer
```

For development purposes clone the [easer](https://github.com/tombenke/easer) server into a folder:

```bash
clone git@github.com:/easer.git
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd easer
npm install
```
